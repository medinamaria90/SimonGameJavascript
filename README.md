Simon game to practice OOP with Javascript

## Overview

The Simon game project is implemented in JavaScript using object-oriented programming principles. It simulates the classic Simon game where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Used for game logic and DOM manipulation.
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements for a visually appealing interface.
- **Bootstrap 5:** Used for responsive design and layout components.

## Files Included

- **index.html:** Defines the structure of the web page, includes Bootstrap CSS, and links to `styles.css` and `index.js`.
- **styles.css:** Contains custom styles for the game interface, including button colors and animations.
- **index.js:** Implements the game logic, including object-oriented classes (`GameSimonClass`) for managing game state, user interactions, and game flow.

## Features

- **Game Initialization:** Starts the game on any key press and resets when the game ends.
- **Color Sequence:** Generates random colors and prompts users to repeat them.
- **Level Tracking:** Updates and displays the current game level based on successful repetitions.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to click on colored buttons to repeat the sequence.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/medinamaria90/SimonJavascriptOOP.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Press any key to start the game.
